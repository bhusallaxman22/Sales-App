# Sales-App
I made it entirely on vanilla javascript.
The app is also able to save previously entered data in localstorage but it save the whole `div`.

<h2>Whats working?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Darkmode toogle.</li>
  <li>Listing tables(add sales `Button`)</li>
  <li>Data is saved on localstorage.</li>
</ol>

Most things look fine and works smoothly.

##If you stumble upon it and want to edit it then correct following things:

<ol>
  <li>Fix the corss button only removing 0th item.</li>
  
  <li>Make it a bit more preetier.</li>
  
  <li>Make use of localstorage accurately</li>
</ol>
